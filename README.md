This is a personal mobileapp project using .NET MAUI.

The idea started year ago when I needed to push people to do their own work. I needed an app to tell people about their deadlines and tasks.
The app is far from ready, but the basic stuff works: Login, create a project with deadline.


Things I still need to do to it:

1. Create more complex login (it has simple login with embedded in code username)
- will create login with DB and google login

2. Create notifivations for dealine
   -if 3 day project-> 3 notifications

3. Create ablitity to login to existing project

4. Create ability for users to chat about projects and congratulate when finishing assainments.
